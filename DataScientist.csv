We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.Clarity Insights is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer.

Ideally, you would have experience either with Mode, a similar visualization tool, or Pythonic approaches to data visualization.

2,Data Scientist - Research and Economics,Uber,"San Francisco, CA, US","Computer,Software,Consumer,Services,Information,Technology,Services","About UberWe’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.About The TeamThe Research and Economics team, led by the Chief Economist, is responsible for addressing the thorny policy and business challenges impacting Uber globally. As a data scientist on this team, you would be expected to bring analytical and empirical rigor to bear on important questions relating to economics, transportation policy, and urban planning.About The RoleDepending on your background and interests, you could focus your work in one of two areas:Economics: Conduct research to understand our business and driver-partners in the context of the economies in which Uber operates. For example: We know that the flexible work model is very valuable to Uber drivers (see Chen et al., Angrist et al.) and that dynamic pricing is vital in protecting the health and efficiency of the dispatch market (see Castillo et al., “Surge Pricing Solves the Wild Goose Chase”); however, it’s likely that consistency (e.g., of pricing or earnings) also carries some value for riders and drivers. What values should we put on these opposing virtues?Cities and Urban Mobility: Study Uber's impact on riders and cities around the world with a special focus on different facets of urban mobility. For example: What is the relationship between on-demand transportation and existing public transport systems. Do they complement or compete with each other? Or, does this relationship change depending on external factors? What could these external factors be and how do they change rider behavior?What You’ll DoConduct rigorous, careful statistical and econometric analysis in support of our research prioritiesDevelop assets (maps, visuals etc.) that explain our research for policy and communications needs Manage relationships with outside academics and research partners to ensure research collaborations run smoothlyCommunicate cross-functionally to understand the intersection of policy, product, legal, and operations and develop research that informs business or policy decisionsPresent your results internally and externally; in some cases, writing academic papers with great researchers from top universitiesWhat You’ll NeedA bachelor’s degree in Economics, Statistics, Math, Engineering, Computer Science, Transportation Planning, or another quantitative field; PhDs welcomedCandidates with a relevant PhD and/or extensive experience will be evaluated (and paid) commensurate with their education and experience.1+ years of quantitative research or data science experienceStrong data skills and the ability to learn to use tools such as SQL, Python, R, and GIS mapping tools to work efficiently at scaleThe capacity to work independently and execute a research plan with minimal oversightThe ability to organize and synthesize analyses and communicate data insights with clarityEnthusiasm for learning and growth",Not Applicable,Full-time,"

This team has already leveraged data science and machine learning techniques to build critical, revenue-driving products for the business. We are actively engaged in bringing research prototypes into production, performing basic research on new initiatives, and developing multiple new products. Our consumption of health data is growing at an exponential rate -- as our Data Scientist, you'll make sense of it all. We ingest clinical data (eg: medical history, allergies, test results) from hospitals and labs, and wellness data (eg: physical activity, sleep, nutrition) from devices and apps. Collectively, these data sets create a more detailed understanding of an individuals health than anything else today. The data recorded from these sources are both continuous and discrete. Using this data, you will contribute to research to enhance and personalize existing products and to develop new products. You will also work closely with data and infrastructure engineers as well as other product teams (e.g. user experience, search) to develop stable, scalable production systems to deliver machine learning driven products to our users. The ideal candidate will be an entrepreneurial, motivated data scientist who is eager to learn new things and make an impact on the industry. Health data experience is a plus, but it's not necessary - the team includes clinical experts who can supply the necessary medical background. You should be interested in solving very tough problems and pragmatic enough to figure out what can be solved now and what should be saved for later. Your team will own:  Build our deep normalization pipeline, creating medical models, and partner with engineering to develop structured APIs with the engineer. Drive the machine regression / classification and normalization pipeline. Develop the NLP required to clean noisy unstructured data. Creating machine learning models in situations where the data is sparse and high-dimensional. Improve the models ten times before an expert can label the data Develop normalization algorithms.

Important attributes: This position is for someone who has built at least one large classification system, dabbled with medical data sets, is well versed with NLP and Machine Learning, and is comfortable coding in languages such as Scala, Java, and Python. You've likely built your own parsers when the open source NLP parsers couldn't do the job and you've built machine learning pipelines.",Mid-Senior level,Full-time,"
