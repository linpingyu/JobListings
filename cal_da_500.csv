aaa8f275ac1f3f3b,Data Analyst,Earnin,"Palo Alto, CA","About Earnin:
Our financial system is fundamentally unfair for people who live paycheck to paycheck. People shouldn't have to wait weeks to get the pay they've already earned. This wait forces them to spend more than $100 billion a year on short-term credit products, late fees and overdraft fees.

Earnin helps people overcome this unfairness by giving them real-time access to their money as soon as they have worked -- without fees or interest.

Our team is bound together by a desire to level the financial playing field. Our investors, Andreessen Horowitz, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Ventures, Matrix Partners and March Capital believe we will change the world.

You can help make a difference. Join us.

About the Team:
Business decisions at Earnin rely heavily on good analysis. Autonomous, cross-functional product and operational teams (we call them ""pods"") drive these decisions on a day to day basis. You'll own this analysis for a particular pod. For success in this role, you'll need to be comfortable taking ownership; in communicating, decision-making, checking your work and making sure that it is followed up with actions from other members of the team.

This position will give you ample opportunity to build your analytics skills. We have a wealth of interesting data sources to draw on and our team uses a highly portable toolkit. We have weekly learning sessions to help facilitate analyst development. You'll work hand in hand with experienced product managers, marketers, and operations leaders.

Our business has interesting characteristics for analysis, e.g. lack of a fixed price or term, heavy dependency on external events and providers, and a very data-rich environment. It also has a large and direct impact on the financial lives of its users.

This role has the potential for massive impact on Earnin's growth trajectory. If you have a passion for helping people as well as a background in data and are interested in applying it to Earnin, we want to hear from you!

What Set Us Apart:
A mission to improve the financial lives of folks who need help
Exceptional product-market fit with NPS scores in the 80s
$60 million raised from top tier fintech investors
Great growth, unit economics and user acquisition costs
As a Data Analyst you will:
Provide colleagues with guidance in making product, marketing and operations decisions from an analytical perspective.
Conduct ad hoc analysis to better understand our users, how to serve their needs and run our business more efficiently.
Create and maintain reporting for business partners.
Some skills we consider critical to being a Data Analyst:
Facility with data manipulation. An ideal candidate is comfortable joining/merging data sets with complex relationships and identifying and troubleshooting data issues. SQL experience preferred, but extensive experience using R, SAS, Excel, etc is also possible.
Can map between real world problems and complex data schema.
Communicates metrics and data clearly.
Works well in a time and resource constrained environment. Can prioritize, get things done on their own, but ask for help when needed.
In addition, we expect you to have or quickly develop:
Experience with R, python, git, schema creation
Data visualization with any of the following tools: Looker, Tableau, R/Python packages, others.
Having supported or worked in a group doing product development, marketing or operations
Statistics or probability background, particularly as applied to split testing or LTV estimation
