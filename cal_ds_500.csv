Location:Redwood City
Date Opened:2018-06-23
Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company. EA delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets.
Here in EA's Data Science group within Global Analytics and Insights, we're always looking for new members to help expand our horizon, to move our communal thought process. Responsible for everything from recommendations and personalization to evaluating the impact of marketing investments, our group exists to push boundaries, whether they are developing cutting edge statistical models and machine learning algorithms for marketing valuation or creating the latest and greatest recommendation systems to ensure that every player journey is truly their own.

This is a team that's as likely to collaborate with game designers and producers as they are data engineers, so versatility, persistence, entrepreneurship, and passion are keys to becoming a successful contributor. We exist in a world where tasks and measures aren't easily defined by product managers or scrums and where a project’s cadence can have defined deadlines or be as vague as knowing a game's possible launch date years in the future, so our data scientists and machine learning engineers must have strong organizational skills. The biggest and single most important aspect that we look for in aspiring colleagues is intellectual curiosity, people who love the joy of discovery, in ending the day knowing a little bit more than when they woke up.
Team-members manage projects in a collaborative, group environment, giving every person an opportunity to lead, and the projects themselves are owned from conception to design, through development and all the way into implementation. Our scope of work ranges from NLP to Recommendation Engines, Statistical Theory to AI, and the variety of responsibilities for our colleagues is equally dynamic: one colleague may bias more towards research, staying in the abstract, while another may prefer to get their hands dirty, building optimization systems directly into game-clients.
We look for PhDs (minimum masters degree) in fields such as computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences, or quantitatively based degrees in social fields, such as quant marketing, sociology, and economics. To be effective, members must have experience interacting with big data stores, wrangling complex data sets, and setting up data processing workflows. All candidates must be accomplished in a modern open source data science languages such as R or Python, while machine learning engineer oriented candidates must also have strong experience in system languages such as Java or C++. More data science-oriented candidates are expected to have good understandings of statistical theory, distributions, experimental design, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and how computational algorithms work. Titles are dependent on the applicant; we look for team-members with all levels of experience.
Gaming is changing. Over the next few years, that change is going to accelerate and without the proper knowledge and toolsets, many developers will struggle to keep up with it. Our job on this team is to ensure that we not only keep pace but become the drivers of that evolution, to help EA lead into the future. We are excited to be a part of this and hope you will be, too.

What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!
We love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks! And since we realize it takes world-class people to make world-class games, we offer competitive compensation packages and a culture that thrives off of creativity and individuality. At EA, we live the “work hard/play hard” credo every day.

Background
Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs. Vital to igniting growth. Vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future of billions around the globe.
But, Innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees have lots of ideas on how to improve a business, but with no formal process, their suggestions go unheard and they give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation labs are expected to support countless different activities to promote innovation but lack the right tools for the job. Executives are seeing disruption everywhere they look and investing millions, but still have no idea where their “next big thing” will come from, or if it will come at all.
At Brightidea, we’ve built a platform that’s solving those problems. We’ve been helping corporate R&D teams be more efficient with the 1.5 Trillion dollars invested annually.

Create the model that transforms an industry
********************************************

Want to bring a $15B sector of the insurance industry into the 21st century? Yearning for a startup built around machine learning? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs title insurance. The current incumbents pay only 5% of their intake as claims; they spend about 85% running a manual process that involves frequent paper searches and phone calls for millions of mortgages every year.

States Title is modernizing this antiquated process and will scale rapidly to grab a large fraction of the market. By bringing data science to title insurance, we can repurpose those wasted billions towards making homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

*************************************************
We're growing our data science team at all levels
*************************************************

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun, diverse, and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at The White House, Google, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

**************************
Do you have what it takes?
**************************

2-10 years of relevant experience in any of the following:
Fintech: you've built credit risk, fraud, or insurance models or algorithms and worked with engineering teams to deploy them
Academia: you've used real-world data to publish highly cited peer-reviewed journal articles on prediction or inference using open source tools
Series A and Series B start-up environments: you've served a catch-all analytics role doing everything from data cleaning to SQL joins to building predictive models
Strengths aligned with our needs
Theoretical background relevant to data science (e.g. Can you explain how to build a random forest without making reference to computers?)
Technical skills (e.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?)
Creative skills (e.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?)
Collaboration skills (e.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?)
In-person, full-time availability
You live in or are willing to relocate to the SF Bay Area
You thrive on in-person interaction and look forward to getting in to work
*************************************************
We want to help you do the best work of your life

26e16e48a8d175b9,Data Scientist - Meta,Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,"Redwood City, CA","Founded by Dr. Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg in 2015, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a new kind of philanthropy that's leveraging technology to help solve some of the world's toughest challenges – from eradicating disease, to improving education, to reforming the criminal justice system. Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values
----------

We believe we can help build a future for everyone.

We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity
---------------

Our mission is to support science and technology that will help make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Interdisciplinary teams of physicians, biologists, computational scientists, and engineers can expand our understanding of the human body and illness — the very science behind medicine. CZI fosters collaboration between scientists and engineers, develops tools and technologies, and builds support for basic scientific research.

The ideal candidate will have a background in a quantitative or technical field and experience working with large data sets and making data-driven decisions. If you are mission-driven, entrepreneurial, and committed to building transformative technologies, we want to hear from you.

Meta is a product that helps biomedical researchers discover literature that's important to their work and delivers it in real-time to their personal feeds. Meta uses artificial intelligence to organize and track over 67 million biomedical diseases, genes, proteins, techniques, researchers, journals, papers, preprints, and more—including full coverage of PubMed and bioRxiv. We believe that the complexity and scale of scientific knowledge is limiting how quickly researchers can understand, navigate and quickly make powerful connections across what is know. This is one of the fundamental challenges hindering the rate of discovery in basic scientific research.

As Data Scientist for Meta, you'll be helping bring Meta to the broader community of researchers around the world. If you want to make a difference and help accelerate innovation in science, come and join us!

With this knowledge, Nauto is powering the development of self-driving technology that brings the best of human driving to autonomy. Are you ready to help with this mission?

We're aiming for greater safety and knowledge: Our approach to re-thinking road safety is two-fold: deepen our understanding of real-world drivers to learn how they interact with the vehicle and road, with the goal of reducing distracted driving and preventing collisions before they occur. Second, apply these insights to the development of safe, effective autonomous vehicles that fit into existing traffic patterns and human driving behavior.

We're taking a driver-centric approach: We surface the safety insights that matter most, while protecting the privacy of drivers. By using artificial intelligence on the device, we're able to detect distractions and immediately warn drivers in real-time. Only a fraction of driving time—such as distractions or other high-risk events—is uploaded to the cloud, where it's automatically visible to fleet managers via a secure web application so they can then better coach drivers.

Investors in Nauto's $159M series B-round included Softbank, Greylock, Playground Global, Draper Nexus as well as leading strategics including BMW, GM, Toyota, and Allianz Insurance.

San Francisco

LiveRamp powers exceptional experiences by making it safe and easy to connect the world's data, people, and applications. We are the industry pace-setter and one of the fastest-growing SaaS businesses anywhere—the enabling product behind many of the world's biggest brands and technology platforms.

We recently debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: RAMP) as an independent public company. Our fundamentals are exceptional: 30%+ annual revenue growth, $1.7B in cash, no debt, and over 600 customers. And we're growing our team at a record pace. Want to build the future with 750 savvy, curious LiveRampers across the U.S., Europe, and APAC? Join us!

Identity Research Data Scientist

Do you crave volumes of data and the tools and resources to analyze it? Do you delight at the prospect of discovering patterns and transforming data into actionable insights? Do you love working collaboratively with intelligent, energetic, no-nonsense colleagues? Are you as nice as you are brilliant? If you've answered ""yes"" to all four questions, we'd like to introduce ourselves.

What You'll Do
--------------

At the core of LiveRamp's products is a massive graph (over a trillion edges) that connects the different anonymous identifiers for each person in the US, their online devices, and the identifiers that over a thousand different marketing platforms use to recognize them. As a LiveRamp Researcher, you'll analyze the complex connections in this graph that contains PBs of data from over a thousand different sources and perform quantitative statistical analysis to understand the structure of data. Further, you'll design and compute statistical models for interpreting this data. We prefer simple models so that we can understand the patterns that they capture, although we have used multilayer neural networks when needed.

To work with this massive dataset, you'll learn cutting-edge big data tools (e.g., PySpark). You'll get elastic compute resources on Google Cloud Platform and we'll trust you to use your judgment in renting large amounts of computing resources as needed (we've used up 20k cores concurrently in our DataProc clusters).

Using the results of your investigations, you'll further develop our conceptual framework for understanding LiveRamp's identity graph, including new terminology, metrics, models, visualizations, and reports. Further, you'll apply this conceptual framework to develop proposals for new data refinement strategies that filter out suspect connections to further enhance the quality of LiveRamp's identity graph. You'll get dedicated coaching from seasoned Research Data Scientists.

Types of projects you'll work on:
---------------------------------

Explore and quantify the reach and accuracy implications for incorporating new sources of identity data into our graph.
Apply modeling to quantify the strength of connections within our graph.
Quantify the holes in our identity graph. I.e., what types of consumers are we missing identity data for?
Create reports and presentations to share your results with our stakeholders.
What You'll Need to Have
------------------------

Ph.D. in a quantitative field or three years of research experience (no exceptions).
Strong grasp of statistics and modeling techniques.
Solid experience with Python, R or other statistical toolsets (we use Python).
Strong technical communication, both written and verbal.
Type S(tartup) personality: smart, ethical, friendly, hard-working and proactive (no exceptions).
Desire to work in San Francisco. We will relocate you if necessary.
What We'll Give in Return
-------------------------

Exceptionally nice and smart teammates
Stock
A generous training budget for whatever you want to develop your skills (e.g., conferences, classes, and books).
Unlimited paid time off
A dog friendly office
Catered meals & stocked kitchen
401K Matching
Commuter benefits
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Competitive medical, dental, & vision insurance
Weekly meditation classes, Hackweeks ( http://liveramp.com/engineering_categories/hackweek/ ), Gardening Club, and team offsites
Events including game nights, happy hours, camping trips, and sporting leagues
Who Are We
----------

We are the leader in data connectivity, helping the world's largest brands ( http://liveramp.com/partners/ ) use their data to improve customer interactions on any channel and device. Our technology unites the marketing technology ecosystem, enabling brands to measure the impact of digital marketing on sales and deliver highly relevant messages to consumers on virtually any channel or device.

We're a startup specializing in applying Natural Language Processing and A.I. to solve problems across a number of exciting industries. We're uncovering the information hidden in vast amounts of dark data and using that information to make smarter decisions and to deliver better products. As a team we value diversity, creativity, new ideas, and a willingness to learn.
We are looking for a Data Scientist with a strong background in Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine and deep learning, statistical modeling, to build experience driven products that will be used every day.
What we’re looking for
Here are a few things that we need you to be good at:
Python, including NumPy, Pandas, and other mathematics and scientific libraries
Tensorflow, Keras, scikit-learn, and other machine learning frameworks
Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, stats, techniques etc.
Experience with things like semantic search, topic modeling, knowledge-graphs, summarization, natural language generation, etc.
You'll be responsible for things like:
Data mining and machine learning using state-of-the-art methods
Selecting features, prototyping algorithms, and optimizing classifiers for production
Augmenting client data with third-party sources or information when needed
Processing, cleansing, and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
Doing ad-hoc analysis and presenting results in a clear manner
And these will score you some bonus points if you have some knowledge and experience of them:
Python server-side application development
Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services
Proficiency in query languages like SQL, Hive, Pig
Ingesting structured and unstructured data
Continuous Learning
Data visualization in Matplotlib, Bokeh
Agile development experience
In addition, we’ll likely get along really well if you:
Constantly reflect on code reuse and modularization (humor is not the only thing you like DRY)
Feel mildly ashamed when QA finds a hole you didn't think of (i.e. you test your own features before considering them ""done”)
Are a data science purist at heart, but a pragmatist in practice
Care little about the buzz in A.I. and rather enjoying finding new solutions to challenging problems
What you’ll be doing
We are using natural language processing, machine learning, and A.I. to solve some of the most interesting and challenging problems facing the world today. Our data science team is only a handful of people, but it is the heart of everything we do, so you’d be coming in near the ground floor with a chance to contribute ideas as much as research or production code.
Why you should join us
We enjoy working hard in a laid back, politics and drama free atmosphere in an office where you’ll find frequent discussions about topics from digital music generation and analysis to visual processing and machine learning. Almost everybody at the company has hobby, music, or artistic projects that they work on the side, so we all value our time away from the office. We want you to be passionate and believe in what we are doing, but we also know that life is too full to spend it all at work. That said, we don’t fear the occasional late night or hard push to get ready for a demo, but strive to hone in our planning to prevent such occurrences from happening frequently.
Still here? Good.
If this sounds like a good fit for you, apply for the job here. Please include links to whatever credentials or sample work you prefer to share (e.g. résumé, portfolio, github, linkedin, etc).

About the job

Research Scientists at Google work closely with Software Engineers to discover, invent, and build at the largest scale. Ideas may come from internal projects as well as from collaborations with researchers at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new learning algorithms, Research Scientists work on challenges in machine perception, data mining, machine learning, and natural language understanding. As a Google Research Scientist, you will continue to be an active contributor to the wider research community by collaborating with academic researchers and by publishing papers.
Researchers on the Google Brain team have the freedom to set their research agenda and to engage as much or as little as they wish with existing products, choosing between doing more basic, methodological research or more applied research as necessary to produce the most compelling results. Because many of the advances we develop today may take years to become useful, the team as a whole maintains a portfolio of projects across this spectrum. It is our philosophy that making substantive progress on hard applications can help drive and sharpen the research questions we study, and in turn scientific breakthroughs can spawn entirely new applications.
The Google Brain team’s research focuses on methods that can learn multiple layers of rich, non-linear feature extractors and can scale to large amounts of data. Much of our work is best understood as part of the deep learning subfield of machine learning, but we are interested in any methods capable of efficient and effective feature learning that get good results on challenging problems. We have resources and access to projects impossible to find elsewhere. Our broad and fundamental research goals allow us to collaborate closely with and–contribute uniquely to–many different product teams across the company.

400830b0abfad98a,Sr. Data Scientist,Abl Schools,"San Francisco, CA","Company Overview

Founded by Adam Pisoni, the co-founder and former CTO of Yammer, Abl ( https://ablschools.com/ ) is an early-stage edtech company developing a data insights platform for K12 principals.

In summer 2017, we launched our first product, a next-generation Master Scheduler that allows school leaders to build student-centric schedules. Master schedules are the pulse of school operations. Current scheduling tools are not designed to help school leaders meet the needs and personal interests of every student.

The Role

We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist, and in this role, you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff. You'll collaborate with a team of product designers, engineers, and school leaders to build software features that help schools overcome complex logistical challenges.

As a Data Scientist at Abl, your work will immediately improve equity in and operations of schools across the country. You will collaborate with product designers to determine what to build and prototype, with engineers to deploy software into production use, and with our schools team to provide decision support for K12 principals who are implementing novel solutions to complex scheduling problems.

Recent data science projects include:
Defining and calculating measures of inequity for students within a school schedule
Building recommendations for course placement in a schedule
Proposing and prototyping algorithms for supporting team teaching best practices
Developing metrics and visualizations for student tracking
The Team

Our product research and development team is small, passionate, and inclusive. You will be the second Data Scientist at Abl and will work across the product and business.

As a data team, our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive, guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next, rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done. For the current stage of our business, our domain, and our customers, we have found that a bias towards reproducible, and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm.

Responsibilities
